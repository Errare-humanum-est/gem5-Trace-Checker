# gem5-Trace-Checker
A python script that can be used to parse gem5 traces to search for deadlocks. Will be extended to support additional statistics in the future. 

Pass a gem5 trace path to the TraceAnalyser and update the stable states and cache names for the MachineClusters. It is vital to update these stable states to find deadlocks in the cache trace.
